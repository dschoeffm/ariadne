Ariadne {#mainpage}
========================

Ariadne is a high-performance software router.
Its basic idea is, to feature a clean and expandable programming interface for future developments.

Architecture

Due to Ariadne's design, the architecture can be adapted for the individual needs of an application.
In its "base form", simply a router is present, using Netmap as its networking framework.
